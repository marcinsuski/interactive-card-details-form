# interactive card details form
 
## Project
Interactive form for registering credit card details - On input, data are shown on a card visualisation next to the form. Responsive design for mobile and PC view. 

## HTML
Two-sided design. Floating cards' visualisation was a bit demanding, especially with the responsive design.

## CSS
Testing both FlexBox and Grid - I'm comfortable with flexbox and I wanted to practice other displays. 
Styling for form errors and controlling succesful form submission.

## JS (VANILLA)
A script for controlling form actions (error/success) and displaying success page (hiding the form class and showing the success one).
